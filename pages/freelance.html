		<p class="introtext">
			I was approached to work on a freelance side-project through a mutual connection. I had never done freelance design and saw this as an opportunity to try something new. 

			My client was a pair of partners who were looking for a product designer to help them flush out their concepts  for a sort of e-commerce platform combined with social. They were still very early in their concept, and wanted help with brainstorming features, wire-framing, and starting to get an mvp design and mockups.

		<p class="sectionhead">
			Getting Started
		</p>
		<p class="introtext">
			The design work started almost completely from scratch. I was brought up to speed on the general concept, and given opportunities to provide my perspective and feedback.

 			I started with creating some storyboards as well as doing some basic mapping of their features and my first stab at organizing in in a mobile app (their chosen form factor for this product).

			Research
		</p>
		<p class="introtext">
			I conducted research by looking into similar products for their design patterns and aesthetics.

			Process
		</p>
		<p class="introtext">
			next up was creating some minimal wireframes based on how I envisioned the process. These wireframes were a key point the clients to start considering the look and feel of the prototype.

		<p class="introtext">
			The clients pushed for something sleek and polished early on, but I pushed back as I considered it more important to really dial in the user experience before we start to focus on aesthetics and fidelity of the mockup. The screens below show some of the exploration for a points/reward system, as well as some quick color treatment.

		<p class="introtext">
			As the designs started to come together, my clients and I were able to determine the key micro-interactions of the product, and what I needed to design solutions for. 

			My deliverable was a figma prototype that was something between a wireframe and high fidelity mockup.

			Taking on a freelance product project was an amazing learning experience for me, but I came to the conclusion that freelance+full-time design job is not a long-term sustainable workload for me.
