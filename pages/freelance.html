		<p class="introtext first">
			I was approached for a freelance project through a mutual connection. I had never done freelance design and saw this as an opportunity to try something new. 

			My client was a pair of partners who were looking for a product designer to help them flush out their concepts  for a sort of e-commerce platform combined with social media.

					Project Summary

		<p class="sumtext">
			A peer-to-peer E-commerce platform based on genuine testimonials and user experiences. I was an acting design partner and product designer, helping my clients with brainstorming features, wire-framing, and creating MVP design and mockups to pitch with.

			Getting Started
		</p>

		<p class="introtextmedium">
			The design work started completely from scratch.
		</p>
		<p class="introtext">
			I was brought up to speed on the general concept, and given opportunities to provide my perspective and feedback.

 			I started with creating some <span class="emphasis">storyboards</span> as well as a first stab at mapping out the <span class="emphasis">system design</span> of a mobile app (desired platform by clients)

			Research
		</p>

		<p class="introtextbig">
			“In hindsight, my least favorite part about this project was the lack of research conducted.” 
		</p>
		<p class="introtext">
			I should have pushed my clients harder for more time for research, but they cited time constraints as a reason against it. The only research I really conducted was looking into similar products for their design patterns and aesthetics. 
		</p>

		<p class="sectionhead">
			Some of products in similar spaces to my client's concept that I researched for patterns.

			Process
		</p>
		<p class="introtext">
			I started with  <span class="emphasis">medium fidelity wireframes</span> based on how I envisioned the product. These wireframes were a key point the clients to start considering the look and feel of the prototype.
		</p>

		<p class="introtext">
			The clients pushed for something sleek and polished early on, but I pushed back as I considered it <span class="emphasis">more important to dial in the user experience before we start to focus on aesthetics and fidelity of the mockup.</span> 
		</p>
		<p class="sectionhead">
			The screens below show some of the exploration for a points/reward system, as well as some quick color treatment.
		</p>
		<div class="intropic">
			<img class="intropic2" src="../assets/freelance/freelance5.png">
			
			</div>

		<p class="introtext">
			As the designs started to come together, my clients and I were able to determine the <span class="emphasis">key micro-interactions of the product</span>, and what I needed to design solutions for. 

			My main deliverable was a figma prototype that was something between a wireframe and high fidelity mockup. 
		</p>

		<p class="introtext">
			Taking on a freelance product project was an amazing learning experience for me, but I came to the conclusion that <span class="emphasis">freelance + full-time design job is not a long-term sustainable workload for me.</span>
