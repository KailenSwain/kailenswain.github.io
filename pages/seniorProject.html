		More than half of this project was spent researching and iterating our idea. We spoke to over twenty  people ranging from experts on the subject to passerbys enjoying the evening at Hayes Valley. 		</p> -->

		I began the project by reading whitepapers on the current theories behind how emotions are created and interpreted by the human brain.

		Initially I wanted to create a wearable or something more tangible, but in my research I discovered that while the technology exists to detect a change of emotional state (heart rate, galvanic cells, etc), there is no technology that can accurately detect what emotion is being felt.

		I created some wireframes for user testing, as well as some more filled in prototype screens for my midterm presentation. From this prototype, I was able to gain some very valuable insight and stories from users.

		<p class="introtext">
		The concept is that this app would start by calibrating a user's baseline emotion, and build a machine learning pattern through user input responses to imagery, color, and word association. Later on, a user could record emotion by relating closely to colors and images, rather than straight up identifying as feeling an emotion.
