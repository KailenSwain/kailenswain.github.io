					Project Summary
		</p>
		<p class="sumtext">
			This was a passion project I started after struggling and juggling travel apps while in Asia recently. This originated from sketches I created on the 14 hour return flight and eventually translated to mockups in Figma upon returning to California.

			THe Problem
		</p>

		

		<p class="introtext">
			During a recent trip to Taiwan and Korea, my family and I found ourselves <span class="emphasis">juggling multiple services and apps </span> when trying to plan our free days. The following scenario actually happened:
			<br>
			1. Asking ChatGPT 4 or Bard  for a specific type of shop near a certain neighborhood that we knew we would be near in Seoul.
			<br>
			2.  Going to google to verify that those results actually did exist and were open (many were not actually there or open)
			<br>
			3. Made a list of points of interest we wanted to visit
			<br>
			4. Adding the POIs to a custom google map to try to eyeball the optimal routing between them based on distance. 
			<br>
			5. Switching to a local navigation app (google maps does not work in Korea) to determine if walking or taking public transit was faster between certain POIs.
		</p>

		<p class="introtextbold">
			Switching between services was a huge pain, and I realized this was a design opportunity.
		</p>

		<p class="introtext">
			On the 14 hour flight back I started brainstorming on my ipad. Before landed in california I had an idea of a quick solution.
		</p>

			What's different from Google Maps?
		</p>

		<p class="introtext">
			While Google Maps has multi-stop functionality, it is optimized for a journey in which a users already knows all of their stops. If a users is unsure or still deciding, <span class="emphasis">they have to disrupt the flow and start over</span> to individually research a point of interest.

			Results

		<p class="introtext">
			Being a passion project I have no real-life statistics to or results to share besides my peers and family agreeing this would indeed be a helpful product.
			<br>Below are more of the screens I created as well as some of my process work.
