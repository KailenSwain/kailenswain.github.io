			<!-- Strava AR is a removeable heads-up display for cyclists that allows for live exploration of user generated routes, besides  providing basic features such as real-time ride data.

			This was a solo project for my behavior class, with the goal of creating a service device that would faciliate behavior change for a user.

			Process
		</p>
		
		<p class="introtext">
		I began this project with the intent to create a device that would ehance and change the behavior of bicycle riders. 		</p>
			<p class="introtext">
		After interviewing bike users of varying skill levels, I focused my project on cyclists who ride for pleasure, rather than commuters or utilitarian riders.</p>
		<div class="intropic">
			
			<img class="thumbnail" src="../assets/strava/interviewees.png">
			
		</div>

		<p class="introtext">
		Using the stories I gathered from interviews, I narrowed the problem down to a few "how might we"" statements. For these problem statements I created 30 seperate concept sheets, which I pinned up and let my peers vote on. 
				</p>

			Digital
		</p>
		<p class="introtext">
		Starting with sketched wireframes, I created screen overlays in Adobe XD. Using Premiere I overlayed these onto a live action video that I shot to demonstrate interacting with the device. 
		</p>

		<div class="intropic">
			
			<img class="thumbnail" src="../assets/strava/screens.png">
		</div>
		<p class="introtext">
		The device is controlled through a combination button and dial, similar to the digital crown on an Apple watch. Route filtering would be done through a screen on the strava mobile app. 
		</p>
		<p class="sectionhead">
			Physical
		</p>
		<p class="introtext">
		To create a physical prototype for filming, I first started with some sketches. Inspiration included Google Glass and the Skully AR motorcycle helmet. I kept the device seperate from the helmet for user flexibility. 
		</p>

			<!-- insert process pic of of sketches -->
		<!-- </div> -->
<!-- 		test -->
		
		<p class="introtext">
		I moved forward with 3D modeling in Autodesk Fusion, fabricating fast and sloppy 3D prints to test the fit and field of view. The mounting system would be a combination of rare earth magnets and 3M adhesive strips. The screens are laser cut scrap acrylic.

			Deliverable
		</p>
		<p class="introtext">
		The screens and phyiscal prototype all came together in a video that I filmed and produced for the final presentation. 
		</p>

				<p class="introtext">
		The device allows a cyclist to record their route, while providing realtime data such as speed and time.

		The device can also be used to discover routes created by other users. Once a route is selected, the device provides a virtual path to follow, as well as performance tracking.
