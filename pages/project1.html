			I used this project as an opportunity to explore an environment in which users do not have smartphone, and require their hands to be free a majority of the time.
			<br>
			<br>
			My solution is a hands-free voice, eye-tracking, and gesture-controlled heads up display, in the form of a small unobtrusive wearable. I designed and animated the above video as a demo for how the product would act.
