			A semester long deep-dive into the near-future of mobility, this project was a collaboration between Ford motor company and the CCA Industrial design department.

		<p class="introtext">
		More than half of this project was spent researching and iterating our idea. We spoke to over twenty  people ranging from experts on the subject to passerbys enjoying the evening at Hayes Valley. 		</p>
		<div class="intropic">

		</div>

		<p class="introtext">
		After over a month and a half of research, we decided to focus on reducing the barrier to entry for existing transit options, while simultaneously improving the current options. 
		</p>

		<div class="intropic">

		</div>
		
		<p class="introtext">
		From the interview data, we not only had a better idea of problems to design around, but also data from which I created a set of user personas. From these personas I created storyboards for our first concept system. 
		</p>

		<div class="intropic">
			
			<img class="thumbnail" src="../assets/fordbase/personas.png">

		<p class="introtext">
		Our first concept included a portable electric mobility device, connected transit hubs, and an app to tie it all together. These are initial mockup screens I made one of our presentations to Ford. 
		</p>
		
		<div class="intropic">
			
			<img class="thumbnail" src="../assets/fordbase/firstscreens.png">
		</div>

		<p class="introtext">
		After presenting our initial concepts to Ford, we moved forward with iterating our concept. Below are some of the many iterations: Digital touchpoints, paper prototypes for user testing, and sketches/CAD models of the physical structures.

			Final Deliverables
		</p>
		<p class="introtext">
		For digital touchpoints, Ford recommended that I focus on a mobile app and hint at a digital kiosk. Among other features, this app enables a user to check live departures, locate a nearby transit hub, plan trips, explore the area, and report an incident or problem.

		The banner below would be displayed inside a transit stop, displaying live arrivals and departures at the curb. This banner was aninmated in Principle and projected onto our model for the final presentation.

		Renders of CAD models were created for our final presentation. We wanted to capture the open-air feeling of a parklet, while designing around the problems that came up in our research.

		<p class="introtext">
		We built a scale model of our physical structure for our final presentation to Ford, with the animation was projected onto the inside to simulate the screen. Designers from Ford were able to sit in our model, and walk around it, so they could understand our vision for the future of mobility.
