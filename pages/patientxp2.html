				Overview

				The Flywire Healthcare Patient Experience is a consumer facing platform for patients to manage and pay their healthcare bills. <span class="emphasis">This is a white-label platform sold to healthcare providers as a portal for their users.</span> Notifications, patient info, and insurance information are all managed in the Patient Experience. While a redesign might not seem significant to improve from a business standpoint, a small healthcare provider in Houston saw their <span class="emphasis">ARR increase from $100k to $233k within less than two months of implementing my designs</span>.

			Existing Product
		</p>
		<p class="textblock">
			Healthcare providers often struggle with online payments and financing options.
			<br>
			<br>
			Money and medical information are very sensitive and serious topics, which requires <span class="emphasis">building trust with users</span>. It was clear that this was something many hospital payment systems were putting little emphasis on. 
			<br>
			<br>
			The existing product when I began this project had a very low conversion rate, around 30% completion of the user flow from initial engagement to payment reciept.

			Process
		</p>
		<p class="textblock">
			Led usability tests of the existing patient experience to confirm painpoints in the experience. Through this I also discovered some crazy edge cases. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Employed the use of analytics tools including MixedPanel to do a deepdive on potential painpoints and dropoff points.
			<br>
			<br>
			Conducted competitive analysis into adjacent products in the Fintech space such as Affirm, Shopify, Square, and Paypal. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Mapped out the existing UX to get a better understanding of the entire system.

			Through social media recruiting, I facilitated usability testing of potential new designs. This qualitatively confirmed that the changes to the experience were removing pain points which would lead to increased completion rate.

				Results

			<p class="textblock">
				When the new design began to be implemented with healthcare providers the positive results were almost immediately visible.
				<br>
				<br>
				For example a smaller provider in Houstin saw their<span class="emphasis"> ARR increase from $100k to $233k within less than 2 months of implementation </span>.
				<br>
				<br>
				Conversion rate for the overall flow went from <span class="emphasis">30% to 70% </span>.
				<br>
				<br>
				Net Promoter Score increased from 4 to 7
