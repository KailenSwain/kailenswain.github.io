			<!-- Strava AR is a removeable heads-up display for cyclists that allows for live exploration of user generated routes, besides  providing basic features such as real-time ride data. 
			<br> -->
			This was a group project for my Experience Design class. We started with the goal of creating a short-term redesign of public transportation, but ended with a present-day solution to a for an overlooked audience.

			Process
		</p>
		
		<p class="introtext">
		We began this project exploring predicted future problems with transportation, as well as future trends in the sector. </p>
			<p class="introtext">
		We decided to focus on accessibility in transportation. Besides having no formal education on the topic, we saw it as a very important aspect of design, and everyone in our group had someone close afflicted by an impairment. </p>

		</div>

		<p class="introtext">
		Using the stories I gathered from interviews, I narrowed the problem down to a few "how might we"" statements. For these problem statements I created 30 seperate concept sheets, which I pinned up and let my peers vote on.

			Digital
		</p>
		<p class="introtext">
		Starting with sketched wireframes, I created screen overlays in Adobe XD. Using Premiere I overlayed these onto a live action video that I shot to demonstrate interacting with the device. 
		</p>

		<div class="intropic">
			
			<img class="thumbnail" src="../assets/strava/screens.png">
		</div>
		<p class="introtext">
		The device is controlled through a combination button and dial, similar to the digital crown on an Apple watch. Route filtering would be done through a screen on the strava mobile app. 
		</p>
		<p class="sectionhead">
			Physical
		</p>
		<p class="introtext">
		To create a physical prototype for filming, I first started with some sketches. Inspiration included Google Glass and the Skully AR motorcycle helmet. I kept the device seperate from the helmet for user flexibility. 
		</p>

			<!-- create some fake process sketches -->
		</div>
		
		<p class="introtext">
		I moved forward with 3D modeling in Autodesk Fusion, fabricating fast and sloppy 3D prints to test the fit and field of view. The mounting system would be a combination of rare earth magnets and 3M adhesive strips. The screens are laser cut scrap acrylic.

			Deliverable
		</p>
		<p class="introtext">
		The screens and phyiscal prototype all came together in a video that I filmed and produced for the final presentation.

				<p class="introtext">
		The device allows a cyclist to record their route, while providing realtime data such as speed and time.
