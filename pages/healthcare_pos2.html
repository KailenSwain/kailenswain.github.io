				Overview
			</p>
			<p class="introtext">
				An often overlooked but vital touchpoint in the healthcare system is the front desk staff. Non-technical receptionists who are the first point of interaction a patient has when they enter a clinic or medical facility for their appointment. <span class="emphasis">This product is a tablet-based tool to expedite payment collection.</span> Combined with a Square card reader or something similar, this enables healthcare staff to quickly collect payments in the reception area.

			Existing Product 
		</p>
		<p class="introtext">
			The existing Flywire staff experience had too many options and screens. This made sense as the existing staff experience was built as a hyper-functional tool for all healthcare staff to use- from customer support specialist to healthcare provider admins.

			Process
		</p>
		<p class="introtext">
			I began by facilitating user research interviews with healthcare staff that used the existing software daily. Through this I gained valuable qualitative data that influenced the new designs.
			<br>
			<br> 
			A key trend that emerged across several interviews was staff were mainly usingthe existing product to collect payments on accounts. Most of the support staff functionality was used by staff in call centers, not front-of-house staff at facilities.
			<br>
			<br>
			Based off several user research sessions, I was able to map out what the ideal flow for a standalone payment collection product would look like.

			Results
		</p>
		<p class="introtext">
			The final product is a tablet based experience designed solely to collect payments. This was consistently the main use case staff had for the existing product.
			<br>
			<br>
			The new straightforward and streamlined user flow met the goal of increasing payment efficiency while also providing a better experience for healthcare staff.
