		Project 1 Placeholder Title

		<p class="introtext">
			For over 3 years I have been the product design lead on this project that lies at the intersection of Healthcare and FinTech.

		<p class="sectionhead">
			What is it?
		</p>
		<p class="introtext">
			The patient experience is a consumer facing platform for patients to manage and pay their healthcare bills. It is where billing notifications are managed, as well as patient info and insurance information. 
		</p>

			Problems
		</p>
		<p class="introtext">
			Problems I have designed solutions for range  financing upcoming hospital appointments with external partners, to solving pain-points throughout the experience using analytic tools like MixPanel. 
		</p>
		
		<p class="introtext">
			Being a startup transitioning to a young company has meant a lot of potential partnerships and initiatives, which has meant designing around how to implement partners into our platform without disrupting the experience. 
		</p>

		<p class="introtext">
			I was not the initial designer for this product, which opened up the opportunity to give it a full visual overhaul of the experience to meet the styling and branding of the new parent company. Below is an example of how to designs looked when I joined the company. 
		</p>

		<p class="introtext">
			I work with multiple product managers as well as other stakeholders to solve design challenges and deliver a smooth experience to our users.

			Research
		</p>
		

		<p class="introtext">
			Being a platform utilized by healthcare patients, it can be challenging to interact with users. First I have to go through the healthcare provider (our customers) to find their customers (our users) who are willing to give their time for live feedback sessions. 
		</p>

		<p class="introtext">
			Besides live-feedback sessions, a brief feedback survey was added to the checkout flow which has provided valuable insights which allowed tweaking of the flow. 
		</p>

		<div class="intropic">
			<img class="intropic2" src="../assets/patientxp/Flywire3.png">
			
			</div>
		
		<p class="introtext">
			Analytic tools like MixPanel opened up conversation with the product managers about specific points in the flow with high drop-off rates. This data allowed me to push for improved designs an A/B testing for certain screens. 
		</p>

		<p class="introtext">
			On top of usability testing and analytics tools, I conducted research into adjacent products in the FinTech space such as Affirm, Shopify, Paypal, and Square. 
		</p>
		
		<p class="sectionhead">
			Results
		</p>

		<p class="introtext">
			Designs that I created led to increased payment flow completion and higher NPS. Less users were dropping off at pain-points after new designs were implemented. A success story I recall is a small healthcare provider in Houston that saw their ARR increase from $100k to $233k in less than two months of implementing my designs.
