		<p class="introtext">
			The Patient Experience is a consumer facing platform for patients to manage and pay their healthcare bills. Notifications, patient info, and insurance information are all managed in the Patient Experience.

					Project Summary
		</p>
		<p class="sumtext">
			For over 3 years, I have been the design lead on this platform that lies at the intersection of healthcare and fintech. I worked with multiple product managers as well as other stakeholders to solve design challenges to deliver a smooth experience to our users.

			The Main Problem
			
		</p>

		<p class="introtextbig">
			“Some hospitals online sites I’ve used to pay my bills are so outdated looking, you question if it’s a scam or the real thing” 
		</p>

		<p class="introtextquote">
			-Usability testing participant
		</p>

		<p class="introtext">
			Money and medical information are very sensitive and serious topics, which requires building a lot of trust with users. It was clear that this was something many hospital payment systems were putting little emphasis on. 
		</p>

		<p class="introtextbold">
			Low trust means less payments made, resulting in low conversion rates.
		</p>

		<p class="introtext">
			Building trust through design was a key value for this project, which many user testing subjects equated with slick, modern, and simple UI/UX.

		<p class="introtext">
			Through conducting live usability testing sessions, I heard stories with edge cases that I wouldn't have ever expected otherwise.
		</p>

		
		<p class="introtextbig">
			“When i received the bill for my emergency room trip, I knew it was going to be high- I was not expecting seven figure balance high”
		</p>

		<p class="introtext">
			Usability tests were also a method to confirm that design changes were indeed improvements to the user experience, rather that just running with assumptions. a brief feedback survey was added to the checkout flow which provided valuable insights which allowed tweaking of the flow.
		</p>

		<p class="sectionhead">
			Other Problems I faced
			
		</p>

		<p class="introtext">
			I was not the initial designer lead for this product, which opened up the opportunity to give it a full visual overhaul of the experience to meet the styling and branding of the new parent company. Below is an example of how to designs looked when I joined the company. 
		</p>

		<div class="intropic">

			</div>


		<p class="introtextmedium">
			It is really hard to get in touch with patients
		</p>
		<p class="introtext">
			Being a platform utilized by healthcare patients, it was often challenging to interact directly with users. First I have to go through the healthcare provider (our customers) to find their customers (our users) who are willing to give their time for live feedback sessions. 
		</p>










		<p class="sectionhead">
			Side Quests
		</p>
		<p class="introtext">
			This was a multi-year project, and I tackled many design scenarios from financing upcoming hospital appointments with external partners, to solving pain-points throughout the experience using analytic tools like MixPanel.   
		</p>
		
		<p class="introtext">
			Being a startup transitioning to a young company has meant a lot of potential partnerships and initiatives, which has meant designing around how to implement partners into our platform without disrupting the experience. 
		</p>

		<p class="introtext">
			
		</p>


		<p class="introtext">
			Analytic tools like MixPanel opened up conversation with the product managers about specific points in the flow with high drop-off rates. This data allowed me to push for improved designs an A/B testing for certain screens. 
		</p>

		<p class="introtext">
			On top of usability testing and analytics tools, I conducted research into adjacent products in the FinTech space such as Affirm, Shopify, Paypal, and Square. 
		</p>
		
		<p class="sectionhead">
			Results
		</p>

		<p class="introtext">
			Designs that I created led to increased payment flow completion and higher NPS. Less users were dropping off at pain-points after new designs were implemented. A success story I recall is a small healthcare provider in Houston that saw their ARR increase from $100k to $233k in less than two months of implementing my designs.
