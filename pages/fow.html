		<p class="introtext">
			This was an interdisciplinary investigation into what the workplace might look like in the next 20-50 years. I worked as the only UX designer in a group of consisting of an Architect, Interior Desginer, and Industrial Designer.

			My Role
		</p>
		<p class="introtext">
			I used this project as an opportunity to explore an environment in which users do not have smartphone, and require their hands to be free a majority of the time.
			<br>
			<br>
			My solution is a hands-free voice, eye-tracking, and gesture-controlled heads up display, in the form of a small unobtrusive wearable. I designed and animated the above video as a demo for how the product would act. 
		</p>

		


		<p class="sectionhead">
			Duration: 15 Weeks
		</p>
		<p class="introtext">
			We designed a modular space station from the ground up that would have the ability to cater to a wide range of uses, intially as a launching point for scientists and researchers, eventually transitioning to a co-working space with fellowships available to membership companies.
